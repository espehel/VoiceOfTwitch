                Here you will be able to find meta data about the channel that is being monitored. 
                There should also be a link to the channel.<br/>
                For instance: 
                <a href="http://twitch.tv/beyondthesummit" title="BeyondTheSummit">BeyondTheSummit</a>.<br/>
                I would also like to present number of viewers and how long the monitoring has been in action.
